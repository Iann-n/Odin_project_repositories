# Odin_project_repositories
I'm just aggregating all of my odin project repositories for convenience and cleanininess sake. I need to declutter my repositories. Not all projects were done, I've skipped a fair bit of few because I have learnt them previously and deemed them not the most useful for advancing to learn react and node.js for future projects
